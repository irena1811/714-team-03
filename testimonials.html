                <p>"Tommy has been my barber for many years now. My first impression was that he was very personable,
                    professional, and provided a level of customer service rarely seen in any customer service industry.
                    I appreciate the fact that he not only remembered my name but remembered the length and style of
                    haircut I like. Now he owns His own Barbershop and I still continue to visit him for my cuts in his
                    new shop."</p>

                    Jason was full of enthusiasm, was more than happy to offer the fresh cut for me and he even
                    suggested a complimentary beverage - what more could I want?!"</p>

                <p>"Without any doubt, this is the best and high-end barbershop in San Francisco.
                    After many unsuccessful attempts to find the special place that will meet my barbering needs, I've
                    eventually found Tommy The Barbershop. Now I am a regular client for more than 4 years. Each member
                    of their team is highly professional. It's really cool here!"</p>

                <p>"Had an appointment with Andrew a couple of weeks ago. He brought out the iPad and we looked through a collection of styles for me to choose from. I chose a James Dean type of look, saw the finished product, and then changed my mind and wanted to go even shorter. No problem at all. Andrew was very nice and professional and clearly understands hair. I have chosen Andrew because a friend recommended him to me and it turned out to be a solid recommendation!"</p>
